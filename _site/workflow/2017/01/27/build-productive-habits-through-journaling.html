        <h1 id="how-i-journal">How I Journal</h1>

<p>I journal by simply responding to a list of questions every night (What did you do today, What are three things you’re grateful for today, etc.).  This takes the least amount of effort, and it ensures that I write about everything I want to write about.  Sometimes I’ll use a notebook and a pencil, and sometimes I’ll use an app called <a href="http://griddiaryapp.com/en/">Grid Diary</a> (see below).  Regaurdless of the method and the meduim, the important thing is that I do it every night.</p>

<h1 id="journaling-makes-you-happier">Journaling Makes You Happier</h1>

<p>Journaling, like meditation, is one of those habits that has the potential to make anyone happier.  Even as long ago as 1998, studies were being done showing how journaling enhances subjects phsycological healing and growth. <sup id="fnref:journaling"><a href="#fn:journaling" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I believe this has a lot to do with how one journals.  A componant I always have in my journal is a list of three events I was greatful for that day.  This way, every night I am thinking about the positives from that day.  This has a more subtle effect on me as well.  Once I have been consistantly journaling for a few weeks, my brain starts subconsiously looking for good events to include on my list at the end of the day.  I find that I start appreciating the good in life more once my brain starts to do this.  This alone is enough motivation for me to continue journaling.</p>

<h1 id="model-habit">Model Habit</h1>

<p>In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485537644&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit">The Power of Habit</a>, <em>Charles Duhigg</em> talks about the concept of a keystone habit.  A <strong>keystone habit</strong> is a habit that helps develop other habits.  The basic idea is that once your body gets used to good habits, like going to the gym, your brain will start to seak out more good habits.  With careful practice, this can snowball into a plethora of good habits.</p>

<p>Journaling is an excellent habit to use as a keystone habit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy</li>
  <li>You must journal every day</li>
  <li>It makes you feel good</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="start-new-habits">Start New Habits</h1>

<p>Besides just being a keystone habit, the journaling itself can allow you to create new habits.  One of the componants I will put into my journal on occasion is one that has to do with a new habit I am cultivating.  This way, every night I will be thinking about the new habit and whether I followed it or not.  Just adding this section can make a huge difference for me.</p>

<h1 id="grid-diary">Grid Diary</h1>

<p>I have recently started using an app called <a href="http://griddiaryapp.com/en/">Grid Diary</a> to do my journaling.  I am not affiliated with the company that makes Grid Diary at all, but I think some of it’s features can make journaling much easier.</p>

<p>You can set up your own questions that are asked each night just like with a paper diary (which still works just fine).  The main draw for me is that Grid Diary can be set up to notify the user every night when it is time to do thier journaling.  This has saved me from simply forgetting to journal that night many times.</p>

<h1 id="stay-consitant">Stay Consitant!</h1>

<p>You can journal however you want, but you must do it every night to be the most efficient in building habits.</p>
