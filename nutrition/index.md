## Book of the Month: *October*
#### [Good Calories, Bad Calories](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462) by *Gary Taubes*
Taubes attempts to re-educate the reader on what is and isn't healthy.  *Good Calories, Bad Calories* presents views that are the opposite of what is commonly preached in the mainstream media.  The content may be a bit biased at times (Taubes himself admits to this), but it's important to be exposed to both sides of any argument.
