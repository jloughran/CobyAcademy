# Why you should be thinking about fats

Fat is one of the only four sources of calories for humans (the others are carbs, protein, and alcohol).  Given how how large a part they play in our diet, it's upsetting that current nutritional research is filled with mixed messages about what types of fats are healthy. [^healthyfats]

Until incredibly recently, the conventional opinion about fats stated that fats are harmful, and the healthy human should do what they can to follow a low fat diet.  We now know that this is *extremely* dangerously general advice.  Although there is probably something to be gained from avoiding certain types of fats, fats are an important part of a healthy diet.  Researchers think that fats help with hormone production, give you a better mood, and give you more energy. [^importantfats]

Many people believe that increased consumption of certain types of fats leads to cardiovascular issues.  This may be true, but recently there has been some research contradicting this long held belief. [^lowcarb] Some experts are even suggesting that limiting refined carbohydrate intake can play a larger roll in cardiovascular health.

# New "healthy" fats

This interesting new research has allowed some new cooking fats to become *trendy*.  The most notable is **coconut oil**.  A few years ago, coconut oil was strictly avoided by health nuts because the saturated fat content is quite high.  Now, many think saturated fats from plant products are not as harmful as those from animal products.  On top of that, coconut oil is high in *medium-chain triglycerides* (MCTs).  It's probably too early to  tell, but some studies are claiming that MCTs have lots of benefits including fat burning. [^mct] In my opinion, these claims are not proven enough to go out of your way to eat more MCTs.

In addition to the newfound popularity of coconut oil, **butter** has made a comeback as a healthy cooking fat.  Now that saturated fats are not deemed evil anymore, many experts are recommending butter over some lower saturated fat counterparts such as margarine or vegetable oils (which I agree with).  As with any cow-related product, grass fed is the best.

# Why I change up cooking fats

I think the best way to stay healthy amid all the contradicting information is to vary your cooking fats.  I constantly switch between butter, coconut oil, and olive oil.  This way, if one of those turns out to be incredibly unhealthy, I'm not eating too much of it.

Changing up cooking fats also gives me the benefit of getting a variety of nutrients.  In addition to the different nutrients from the fats themselves, using different cooking fats encourages me to cook different types of foods.  Some foods taste better with butter than others.  Having a variety of nutrients will help your body function properly.
