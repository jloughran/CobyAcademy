Whether it's dapping up your best friend or simply giving a hug to your mother, physical contact is the easiest way to show affection to somebody you know. As simple as it may seem, the act of touching goes a long way towards building relationships. This is especially important when it comes to talking to girls. Physical contact during conversation is vital to having a successful interaction even if that simply means having a nice banter.

I've summarized a few key benefits from physical contact in conversation below along with a few occasions where touching is valuable. Notice how *physical contact* is not groping girls randomly and inappropriately, but subtle gestures that are natural to the progression of the conversation.

# **Physical contact** ~~tells~~ *shows* the woman you are interested.

A woman's native tongue is her body language. Although she may say one thing to you, her body language could be directly contradicting her words. And 99% of the time, her body language is expressing her true feelings. For example, let's say you are talking to *Kate* at a party. Kate is telling you how she recently broke up with her boyfriend and is not looking for a guy at the moment; yet she keeps twirling her hair and touching you on the arm. Regardless of what Kate is saying, her body language is telling you to make a move (She's also giving you a form of a [shit test](https://illimitablemen.com/2014/12/14/the-shit-test-encyclopedia/), but that's a whole other article).

So if women use body language to convey their feelings, why not communicate in their natural language? Don't just tell her how you feel; *show* her. It's amazing how many guys will refuse to make physical contact with girls during conversation. I've heard dozens of excuses ranging from "I'm not sure she's into me" to "it's not polite to lay your hands on her for no reason" - but we all know the real reason: fear. Let her know that you aren't afraid to touch her and that you are attracted to her. Which leads me to my next point...

# **Physical contact is essential for things to escalate.**

This may seem obvious, but it is crucial to understanding why some guys make it seem to easy to kiss girls while other guys get rejected even after the woman shows interest. In order to kiss a girl, she needs to become comfortable with you. And that cannot happen unless you make preliminary steps before attempting the kiss. It's like throwing a baseball: you're not going to go out onto the field and try to throw a ball over the fence from home plate without warming up. Women must be warmed up to the idea of being with you. Light touches on the arm or waist is a great way for a woman to gauge whether she wants to escalate things with you. If she feels excited or aroused by your hands on her, she'll start giving you more obvious signs that she wants to be kissed.

# **Physical contact portrays confidence and comfortableness with your sexuality**.

There is little that is more attractive to girls than confidence (notice I said *confidence*, not *cockiness*). A timid man is too scared to touch women during the course of conversation, but a confident man is not afraid to make physical contact. If she isn't receptive, so what? Chances are she doesn't find you attractive, and you never would have been able to kiss her anyway. This is also known as *polarization*: forcing women to choose between seeing you as more than a friend and rejection [^footnote] .  The lack of polarization leads to....you guessed it: the dreaded friend zone.

Being a confident man also leads to another attractive benefit - expressing your sexual desires freely. People have finally started to figure out in the past two decades that women are just as sexual as men. The problem is the double standard that culture forces upon them: being too sexual is perceived as sluttiness. Women want to be touched by an attractive man, and it's your job to be that man. By making the physical contact with her, it shows her you are not too reserved to become sexual with her. You realize that this is a natural part of the progression, and she can either be receptive or not.

# **Examples**

I've listed some easy actions to incorporate into your conversations with girls below. Pick and choose which ones work to your personality.

 - Thumb wars, pinky promises, high fives, etc. - These are simple and show your ability to be silly. If you do a thumb war, try cheating very obviously and denying it. If you pinky promise, tell her to kiss her own thumb and do the same.

 - Secret handshakes - make them as simple or as complicated as you like, but make it original. Girls love feeling special; this is a great way to do just that. Note: be weary of ending in the friend zone with this one. Use this in addition to other forms of physical contact.

 - When introducing yourself, try kissing your own hand. It's unexpected and shows your sense of humor. Most of the time she'll say, "You just kissed your own hand!" like you didn't already know that. If she does, apologize and proceed to kiss your own hand again. Not only will she laugh, but this also lets her know subconsciously that you are independent and won't pander to them.

 - If she's in good shape, ask her if she works out. Feel her arms, and tell her she's ripped. If the conversation is going well (and you're feeling bold), tell her she must squat as well, and lightly touch her butt.

 - If you're at a venue where it's loud, always lean in close to talk to her. Accentuate this by placing your hand on her hip when you're talking and taking it off after the sentence is finished. You'll find that she will tend to mirror your conversation body language.

 - If you're at a venue with music, grab her hands and dance with her (not next to her!). If you're not a good dancer, as most of us aren't, be silly: spin her around, pretend to ballroom dance, etc.

As you continue to make more and more physical contact with women in conversations, you'll find things that work and things that you should never do again. For instance, I've found that the shoulder is way less sexual than the arm or elbow. Some women don't like their face being touched. Make sure you tailor your contact with your personality. Shyer guys will tend to have more intimate, subtle contact while outgoing men can get away with more outlandish acts such as over-the-top handshakes. Last but not least, find a middle ground with what works for both you and the woman you are talking to. If you are an extrovert and she is more reserved, don't make her feel uncomfortable by acting like a fool on the dance floor or attempting lots of PDA.

Good luck!
